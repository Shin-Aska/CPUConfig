CPUConfig
===========================================

Graphical user interface for managing CPU for Linux systems.It can only provide controls for settings that the CPU allows to be change from the Operating System level. Any modifications that needs to be done on the BIOS level are not supported.

This tool is originally created to allow modifying Turbo boost's maximum CPU frequency in a GUI level. Later on it will support other functionalities such as dynamically changing the maximum CPU frequency based on CPU load and temperature this way we don't need the CPU to throttle itself and possibility other features.
